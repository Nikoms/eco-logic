### Quick Start

Just clone this repository into your own project folder. and start working

```
git clone https://github.com/gilamran/fullstack-typescript.git <MyProjectName>
cd <MyProjectName>
npm install
npm run dev
```

If you want to detach from this repository into your own repository do this:

```
git remote remove origin
git remote add origin YOUR_REPO_URL
git push -u origin master
```

## Why

- **Simple** to jump into, **Fast** because it is simple.
- Separate `tsconfig.json` for client and server.
- Client and server can share code (And types). For example: [IUserDTO.d.ts](https://github.com/gilamran/fullstack-typescript/blob/master/src/shared/IUserDTO.d.ts)
- The client is bundled using [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) because it goes to the browser.
- The server is emitted by [TypeScript](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript) because node 6 supports es6.

### What's included

- [React v16](https://facebook.github.io/react/)
- [React router v4](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router)
- [Material-ui](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui)
- [Jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest)
- [Css modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules)
- [Axios](https://github.com/mzabriskie/axios) (For Client/Server communication)

### Usage

- `npm run dev` - Client and server are in watch mode with source maps, opens [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- `npm run test` - Runs jest tests
- `npm run build` - `dist` folder will include all the needed files, both client (Bundle) and server.
- `npm start` - Just runs `node ./dist/server/server.js`
- `npm start:prod` - sets `NODE_ENV` to `production` and then runs `node ./dist/server/server.js`. (Bypassing webpack proxy)

### Config

All applications require a config mechanism, for example, `SLACK_API_TOKEN`. Things that you don't want in your git history, you want a different environment to have different value (dev/staging/production). This repo uses the file `config.js` (not ts) to access all your app variables. And a `.env` file to override variable in dev environment. This file is ignored from git.
